# DevOps-Course-2024
This repository gives an overview of my journey through the Devops course i took in the 7th semester of university. It focuses on core concepts, tools, and skills that I have learned, as well as practical applications and insights and summaries of my blogs related to Devops.

#### [Traditional vs Docker: The Easiest Way to Setup a Minecraft Local Server](https://medium.com/@moazfarrukh/traditional-vs-docker-the-easiest-way-to-setup-a-minecraft-local-server)  
In this blog i compare two methods for setting up a local Minecraft server: the traditional manual approach and a streamlined Docker-based method. The traditional method involves installing dependencies, configuring firewalls, and manually setting up the server, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. In contrast, Docker simplifies the process with a single command that leverages containerization, automates configuration using environment variables, and isolates the server environment from the host system. For added flexibility, Docker Compose allows easy server configuration using a YAML file. The blog highlights that while the traditional method offers hands-on control, Docker's efficiency and ease of use make it the preferred option for most users.

#### [Managing Microservices Made Easy: Using Linkerd with Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@moazfarrukh/managing-microservices-made-easy-using-linkerd-with-kubernetes)  
This guide demonstrates how to use Linkerd, a lightweight service mesh, to simplify service-to-service communication in a Kubernetes environment. Using the Emojivoto demo application, it covers:
- Deployment: Setting up the application on Kubernetes.
- Linkerd Installation: Installing and configuring Linkerd to enhance security and observability.
- Integration: Injecting Linkerd into services for traffic management and monitoring.
- Service Profiles: Defining policies like retries and timeouts with minimal code changes.

Linkerd provides secure, reliable, and observable communication, making microservices architectures more scalable, manageable, and resilient.
