# DevOps-Course-2024 🚀  
This repository gives an overview of my journey through the DevOps course I took in the 7th semester of university. It focuses on core concepts, tools, and skills that I have learned, as well as practical applications, insights, and summaries of my blogs related to DevOps.

## Blogs 📚  

### Blog 1 📝  
#### [Traditional vs Docker: The Easiest Way to Setup a Minecraft Local Server](https://medium.com/@moazfarrukh/traditional-vs-docker-the-easiest-way-to-setup-a-minecraft-local-server)  
In this blog, I compare two methods for setting up a local Minecraft server: the traditional manual approach and a streamlined Docker-based method. The traditional method involves installing dependencies, configuring firewalls, and manually setting up the server, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. In contrast, Docker simplifies the process with a single command that leverages containerization, automates configuration using environment variables, and isolates the server environment from the host system. For added flexibility, Docker Compose allows easy server configuration using a YAML file. The blog highlights that while the traditional method offers hands-on control, Docker's efficiency and ease of use make it the preferred option for most users. ⚙️🐳

### Blog 2 📝  
#### [Managing Microservices Made Easy: Using Linkerd with Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@moazfarrukh/managing-microservices-made-easy-using-linkerd-with-kubernetes)  
This guide demonstrates how to use Linkerd, a lightweight service mesh, to simplify service-to-service communication in a Kubernetes environment. Using the Emojivoto demo application, it covers:  
- **Deployment**: Setting up the application on Kubernetes.  
- **Linkerd Installation**: Installing and configuring Linkerd to enhance security and observability.  
- **Integration**: Injecting Linkerd into services for traffic management and monitoring.  
- **Service Profiles**: Defining policies like retries and timeouts with minimal code changes.  

Linkerd provides secure, reliable, and observable communication, making microservices architectures more scalable, manageable, and resilient. 🛠️🔧  

## Applying Devops Tools
I have demostrated how to apply devops tools to turn a application into production ready for deployment using my own MERN application [budget tracking app](./budget-tracking-app)  
## Resume 📄  
You can view my [resume](./Resume.md) for detailed information about my professional experience, technical skills, education, and significant projects. It highlights my journey as a developer and showcases my contributions to real-world applications in web development, backend engineering, and DevOps practices. 👨‍💻
